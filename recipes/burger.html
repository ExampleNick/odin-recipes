        <p>Making a good homemade burger isn't hard, but there are rules to follow — starting with the type of ground</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>1 1/2 pounds ground beef (80% to 85% lean)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Kosher salt</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Freshly ground black pepper</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>4 to 6 hamburger buns, split</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Butter or oil, for the pan</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>4 to 6 slices cheese, such as cheddar, swiss, American, or provolone (optional)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Burger toppings: sliced tomatoes, sliced onions, lettuce, ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, pickles, relish</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Divide 1 1/2 pounds ground beef into 4 or 6 portions, depending on the number of burgers you would like to make.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Gently press each portion of ground beef into a disk about 1-inch thick. Press the middle to create a shallow "dimple" and pat the edges into a round — the patty should look like a frisbee and be slightly larger than your burger buns. Don't worry if there are some cracks in the edges; try not to mash the beef too much as you shape the patties.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Heat a pat of butter or a teaspoon of oil in a griddle or large skillet over medium heat.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Working in batches if needed, place the bun halves cut-side down in the warm butter or oil. Toast until the surface is golden-brown. Transfer the toasted buns to a serving plate.</p>
            </li>         
            <li>
                <p>Increase the heat to medium-high, and keep a careful eye on the pan. When you see the first wisp of smoke, you're ready to cook the burgers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Place the burger patties in the hot pan, leaving a little space between each one. Work in batches if necessary. The burgers should sizzle on contact — if they don't, nudge the heat up a little. Generously season with salt and pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Quickly slide a spatula under the burgers and flip to the other side. You should see a dark brown sear on the underside — if not, increase your heat next time. Season the other side generously with salt and pepper, and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes to your preferred doneness. If the burger falls apart when you flip, just press the edges together and carry on — your burger will still be great!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If making cheeseburgers, top the burgers with cheese as soon as you flip them. If the cheese isn't melting fast enough, cover the pan with a lid or other dome to encourage the cheese to melt.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>When the burgers have finished cooking, transfer them to the toasted buns and finish with your favorite burger toppings.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
